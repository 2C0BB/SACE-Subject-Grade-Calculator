# SACE-Subject-Grade-Calculator
A python script to calculate a single subject's overall/end of year grade for SACE subjects.

WARNING: The weightings in the current version of the script may not be accurate to the future, so either check or use with caution. It should be fine for a few years though.

## Use cases
This can be useful for two main reasons:

1: Having done a portion of a subject, determining what scores are needed to get the final grade you desire.

2: With a rough knowledge of how you've done on, say, an exam, how well the overall grade will be.

## What it does and doesn't take into account
This script will take into account the weighting of each assesment type, and will do the averaging and conversions. However, this will not take into account moderation changes and scaling factors. Therefore, this should not be used as the final definitive source on what your final grade will be.

## Future updates
At the time of writing this, this only has support for a few subjects. More will be needed to be added. This would be good to seperate into a different file for ease of update as SACE changes. Compiling this into distributals like a .exe, .app, or a linux app would be good.
