# SACE-Subject-Grade-Calculator
A python script to calculate a single subject's overall/end of year grade for SACE subjects. How to use instructions at the bottom

WARNING: The weightings in the current version of the script may not be accurate to the future, so either check or use with caution. It should be fine for a few years though.

## Use cases
This can be useful for two main reasons:

1: Having done a portion of a subject, determining what scores are needed to get the final grade you desire.

2: With a rough knowledge of how you've done on, say, an exam, how well the overall grade will be.

## What it does and doesn't take into account
This script will take into account the weighting of each assesment type, and will do the averaging and conversions. However, this will not take into account moderation changes and scaling factors. Therefore, this should not be used as the final definitive source on what your final grade will be.

## Future updates
At the time of writing this, this only has support for a few subjects. More will be needed to be added. This would be good to seperate into a different file for ease of update as SACE changes. 

Compiling this into distributals like a .exe, .app, or a linux app would be good, or at the very least adding a script for each os to allow non tech-savvy people to launch the application easily.


# Use instructions

## For Windows
*Add Description*

## For MacOS
Open the terminal app either through spotlight or through launching the app inside the utilties folder inside the applications folder. Then navigate (use online tutorial) to the app, and enter `python SACEgradeCalculator.py` to run it

## For Linux
If you're using this you surely know how to use the terminal. Run `python SACEgradeCalculator.py` in the same directory as the script.
